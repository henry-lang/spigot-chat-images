# ChatImages (Spigot Plugin)

This is a Spigot plugin that adds a command for sending images in chat. They are fetched from the web and then reduced in size to fit in Minecraft Chat. It uses Minecraft's new hexadecimal chat feature to use true RGB color instead of legacy chat formatting. Still trying to figure out how to downscale with aspect ratios though.

I don't care as long as you mention that I wrote it.
